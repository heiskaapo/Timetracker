This is a basic webapp, that functions as a clock. It includes multiple problems in the sourcecode. 
Some of which are 
1. The style of the code 
2. At the time clock reaches zero, the functionality is problematic. 

The purpose of the project was to practise skills for the freecodecamp frontend projects.
