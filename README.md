# helsinki_biking_app
This is a repository for the app that I created to visualize the city bike traffic in helsinki. 
As the data source I used the site (https://hri.fi/data/dataset?vocab_keywords_fi=kaupunkipy%C3%B6r%C3%A4t) which lists 
information about the public transport of helsinki, including info about specific bike stops, and data about trips done during the last
(finished) bike season.
